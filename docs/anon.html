                    <dd>
                        It is not possible to become completely anonymous online. Because of the nature of the Internet,
                        the amount of data about yourself you can find out there is surprising. However, there are a few
                        ways that you can remain as close to anonymity as possible.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><h3>Zone 1: Basic Privacy</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        A basic component of staying secure and anonymous online is a secure password. Using generated
                        passwords from a password manager makes your online presence way more secure and private. Using
                        2-factor authentication like Google Authenticator or SMS 2-factor adds a whole new layer of security.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Surprisingly enough, your web browser and search engine preferences also have a hand in your Internet
                        anonymity (or lack thereof). Most search engines track you through each site you visit, so using a
                        search engine without tracking like DuckDuckGo prevents you from being detected around the web.
                        Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) masks your IP address and can spoof the country you log in
                        from, making your connection's point of origin a mystery.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Social media can expose a lot of your personal data and lower your level of anonymity. Hiding your
                        personal information like addresses or birthdays is a crucial step to privacy and security.
                        Not talking to strangers, not posting public comments, disabling the app's permissions on your device,
                        and not posting clear pictures of yourself all help maintain security.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Avoid putting your phone number on the Internet when you can, as doing sso can expose you to
                        telemarketers and scam calls. Keeping your phone or computer itself secure by disabling app
                        permissions and using a secure pin keeps your devices safe.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><h3>Zone 2: More Complex Privacy</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        There are various ways to communicate securely online. Apple's iMessage or the app Signal both keep
                        messages encrypted and safe from prying eyes. Email is surprisingly vulnerable, as providers get full
                        access to your emails. Using an encrypted email provider keeps your messages private and free of corporate
                        surveillance.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Your choice of device also has a hand in security. iPhones are more secure than Androids if
                        you're not as technically savvy. Keeping PC or phone storage encrypted is extremely
                        important in terms of device safety. Using a Chromium browser like Google Chrome allows Google to
                        collect all your data, so a privacy-based browser like Firefox helps keep you secure.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><h3>Zone 3: Drastic Privacy</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Your operating system has a hand in your anonymity online. Switching to a Linux build is the most secure
                        operating system you can use. Having your BIOS password protected prevents malicious users from changing
                        core settings on your PC. Ditching Google and all of the data they have collected on you helps maintain
                        your anonymity at the corporate level. Ditching social media, while drastic, will remove a whole facet
                        of your public online presence.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Switching your phone to a no-Internet flip-phone or an Android with a privacy custom ROM significantly increases
                        your security. Paying anonymously with cryptocurrencies or prepaid debit cards makes it nearly impossible
                        to track your online commerce.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><h3>Zone 4: Extreme Privacy</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Using nothing but a flip phone for calls only prevents you from being tracked through your phone (at least
                        from ISPs and corporations). Spoofing your MAC address is essentially a fake ID for entering a WiFi Network
                        and it hides your presence.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Avoid social engineering aiming to get data on you. Don;t talk to strangers, never give real personal
                        information, and changing your speech pattern online makes you more anonymous. A drastic step is to
                        completely remove your online identity and delete any online accounts you have.
