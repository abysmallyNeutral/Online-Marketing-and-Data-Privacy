                <dl>
                    <dt><h3>1. Internet Browsing History</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        You are usually tracked online by your IP address and emails. Every site you visit online tracks
                        your time spent there and leaves what are called ‘cookies’ on your computer. ‘Cookies,’ are best
                        thought of as crumbs. They remain in your machine and keep track of everything you’ve done. This
                        is what allows you to log-in to previously viewed websites without being prompted to manually enter
                        passwords and usernames whenever. It keeps you logged in, or your data will already be pre-filled
                        before you log in. This can also be a method that companies can see what items you're viewing
                        when shopping or what articles you're reading on a news site or what you're researching on any
                        given day. This helps companies and organizations determine the way to engage with you and which
                        product descriptions and pop-up ads will attract you to shop for or click.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        To get around this, you have to actively clean out your search history, and set your viewing
                        patterns to private. Anything from Google Chrome, Firefox, all versions of Safari, Internet Explorer
                        Opera, and AOL, among others, can be cleaned out.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><h3>2. JavaScript Search Engines</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        StartPage, Google Chrome, Firefox, Duck Duck Go, and Cyber Ghost are alternative options to
                        traditional search engines that track your behavior and choices online. Basic search engines use
                        JavaScript. JavaScript is like the glue that keeps the Internet together. But it’s also what’s
                        used in ‘cookies.’ If you are trying to avoid being tracked online, JavaScript, in a sense, is
                        your enemy. You should take precautions to protect yourself from them.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><h3>3. Suspicious Emails</h3> (+ Friend Requests From People You Don’t Know)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is one way Internet users stumble and invite spying and stalking, without knowing it.
                        In recent news, police were using fake Facebook accounts to spy on users. Take time to look
                        through all of your online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Remove and block contacts
                        that send you spam messages. Don’t positively engage in your network or those with whom you have
                        no connections or don’t know in real world . It’s not impolite to say no to invitations that won’t
                        work for you, especially if you don’t even know the person extending the invitation or what their
                        intention is.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><h3>4. Don’t post personal Information Online.</h3></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Avoid birth dates, middle names, maiden names, social security numbers, telephone numbers, bank
                        numbers or personal information on family members. Don’t post photographs that you would feel
                        uncomfortable for others to see or potentially copy and re-use. This can be difficult, but setting
                        your accounts to private and screening all friend requests is one to protect yourself and avoid
                        being tracked online.
